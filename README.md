# Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.

## How it works
1. The program randomly picks a number between X and Y.  
2. The user tries to guess the number.  
3. The program tells the user if the guess is too high or too low, until the user gets it right.  
4. On success, the program tells how many attempts the user took.
